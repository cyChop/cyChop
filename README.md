### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This Github profile is where I started my code-sharing adventures.
Repos come and go, as most of them are proof-of-concepts and experiments.


#### Moving out

In my search for a more Open Source tool, I tend in moving from Github to GitLab.
Find [my profile](https://gitlab.com/cyChop) there.


#### My projects

Repositories directly under my user are mostly proof-of-concepts and code trials.
For my more constructed projects, I recommend having a look at [the KeyboardPlaying organization](https://github.com/KeyboardPlaying) (though you'd rather look at it [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/keyboardplaying) for the most recent and up-to-date projects).

I'll spend some time in an undefinite future cleaning this profile by removing obsolete repositories and moving my most valuable PoCs to GitLab.
See you around!


#### Other resources

You can have a look at [my website](https://keyboardplaying.org) for a technical blog and short stories (also [in French](https://keyboardplaying.fr)).
I also use my [main Twitter account](https://twitter.com/cyChop) to share news about sustainability in IT.
